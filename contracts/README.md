## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Algorand Sandbox or node access
- AlgoKit CLI tools
- Sufficient ALGO for deployment

### Deploy Contracts

```bash
# Deploy all contracts to testnet
npm run deploy:contracts:testnet

# Deploy to mainnet (production only)
npm run deploy:contracts:mainnet
```

### Verify Deployments

```bash
# Verify contract deployments
npm run verify:contracts
```

## Development

### Testing Contracts

```bash
# Run contract unit tests
npm run test:contracts

# Run integration tests
npm run test:contracts:integration
```

### Local Development

1. Start Algorand Sandbox:
```bash
./sandbox up testnet
```

2. Deploy contracts locally:
```bash
npm run deploy:contracts:local
```

## Contract Addresses

### Testnet
- Global Challenges: `[APP_ID_TO_BE_FILLED]`
- Match Verification: `[APP_ID_TO_BE_FILLED]`
- Reputation System: `[APP_ID_TO_BE_FILLED]`
- Squad DAO: `[APP_ID_TO_BE_FILLED]`

### Mainnet

## Security Considerations

- All contracts undergo thorough testing before deployment
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Regular security audits and code reviews
- Emergency pause mechanisms where appropriate

## Contributing
