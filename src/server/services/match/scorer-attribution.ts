/**
 * Scorer → player attribution for chat-logged matches.
 *
 * The match parser (`@/lib/ai/match-parser`) captures goalscorers/assisters by
 * NAME ("I bagged 2, Sammy got the other"). This resolves those names to the
 * logging squad's `PlayerProfile`s. The resolved goals/assists are then handed
 * to `submitMatchResult`, which writes them onto `PlayerMatchStats` inside the
 * seed→XP window so career totals + XP pick them up on every verification path.
 *
 * INTEGRITY FIRST — stats are how the group remembers a player, so this resolver
 * is deliberately conservative: it only credits a goal when it is confident who
 * scored (self-reference, an exact name, or a unique first name). Anything
 * ambiguous is returned as `unresolved` and logged as a plain team goal rather
 * than guessed onto the wrong player.
 *
 * Pure — no Prisma, no I/O. The write path lives in `submitMatchResult`.
